### Prompt
You get a million dollars,
but once a month you wake up in a random bed somewhere in the world.
This will only happen twelve times (one year).
Once teleported,
you have 24 hours until you are teleported back.
You will not know when in the month you will be teleported.

### More constraints
1. You are teleported with your clothes as well as any items you have attached to your torse.
2. You are guaranteed five minutes alone in the room you wakeup in.
3. You will teleported to somebody's bed.
In other words,
you will not wakeup in a hotel, prison, or on abandoned cot in the Sahara.

Do you take the million dollars?

### Fun Twists
1. Instead of waking up in a random bed somewhere in the world,
you wake up in the bed of an acquaintance you know.
