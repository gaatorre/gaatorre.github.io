We put up with a fair bit of annoyances in our daily lives.
From living with that one housemate who forgets to flush the toilet sometimes to the blister your new Dr. Martens left on your left ankle.
But,
these annoyances come and go.
Sometimes your housemate does flush and your new boots break in after a few weeks.
The fact that these annoyances are temporary makes them tolerable.
But what if they were longer term?
And what if there was $$$ at stake?

This page is dedicated to scenarios of annoyances that linger longer than we're used to.
We ask questions like:
> You get a million dollars,
> but every shoe you wear for a year gives you blisters.
